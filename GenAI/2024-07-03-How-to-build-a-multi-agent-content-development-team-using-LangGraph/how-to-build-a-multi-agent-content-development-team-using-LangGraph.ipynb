    "# Multi-Agent Content Development Team using LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "Heyooo! I'm back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don´t know if you all read my first blog post about **LangGraph**, If you didn’t and want to check out some basics, here it is: [What is LangGraph and Can It Help You Build LLM Agents?](link)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyways, today we are gonna dive a little deeper into **LangGraph**. I'll try to show you how to build a simple but usefull multi-agent team. While doing that, we are going to revisit some concepts to better understand how everything works, where things come from, and where they are going, as LangGraph can be a little tricky for newcomers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Lan...\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This again?\" One might ask. Yeah, bear with me, let's fix this concept once and for all!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, as I was saying, **LangGraph** is an extension of **LangChain**, whose main objective is creating agent and multi-agent projects. It adds the ability to create cyclical flows while providing developers a high degree of control, which is - obviously - very important for creating custom agents and flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that's enough theoretical jibber jabber for now. Let's start building something!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the - not the best - but pretty good Content Development Team\n",
    "\n",
    "With this project, I want to show you all that we can improve almost any process in depth and quality by leveraging multiple agents with specialized skills. Why is that? Well, having every agent focus and specialize only in a specific task allows more customizability, better separation of concerns, and, of course, further development as the project grows. LangGraph is no place for a jack of all trades.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Content Development Team\n",
    "\n",
    "Our humble team consists of three agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Researcher** - This fella is specialized in web search. He will deliver in-depth research on a given topic. No questions asked.\n",
    "* **Editor** - The role of this agent is to be annoying with his buddy the researcher. The editor will review the content brought by the researcher agent and demand more whenever he thinks it's needed. He will also provide some query tips.\n",
    "* **Writer** - This is the last agent of our flow, responsible for writing about the suggested topic using the context available from the previously mentioned agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### As promised, we will now dive into the code!!"

      "In the world of language models and AI applications, two key tools have been making waves: LangChain and LangGraph. While both are designed to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they serve different purposes and offer unique features. Let's dive into the differences between LangChain and LangGraph to understand how they can benefit developers and users alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "LangGraph is a powerful library that focuses on building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It extends the LangChain Expression Language to enable the coordination of multiple chains or actors across various tasks. This means that developers can create complex applications that involve multiple actors working together, making it ideal for scenarios where collaboration and coordination are essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, LangChain is a comprehensive framework that aims to streamline the development, productionization, and deployment of applications powered by LLMs. It acts as a bridge between the raw computational power of LLMs and practical, real-world applications, allowing developers to leverage the full potential of LLMs in their projects. LangChain is particularly useful for developers looking to harness the capabilities of LLMs beyond just language processing, enabling them to create a wide range of AI-powered applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "One key difference between LangChain and LangGraph lies in their focus and functionality. While LangGraph is geared towards building multi-actor applications and coordinating tasks across different chains, LangChain is more focused on facilitating the development and deployment of LLM-powered applications. This distinction makes each tool suitable for different use cases and scenarios, depending on the specific requirements of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, both LangChain and LangGraph offer valuable tools and capabilities for developers working with LLMs. Whether you need to build complex multi-actor applications or streamline the deployment of LLM-powered projects, these tools can help you achieve your goals efficiently and effectively. By understanding the differences between LangChain and LangGraph, developers can choose the right tool for their specific needs and unlock the full potential of large language models in their applications.\n"
